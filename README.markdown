# Link Exchange Manger (LEM)

LEM is an application for keeping track of link exchanges that some website owners do. Most website owners use Excel for this task, but I wanted an application that would automate some of the tasks associated with that. It also gave me a chance to learn a bit about the Meteor JS framework and Twitter Bootstrap.
